    Now I know how it feels: serendipity; <br>
    I sensed it on that 26th of June. <br>
    At first glance ecstasy, <br>
    by the drapery, <br>
    where I first met you.

    AIMING A LOT OF THINGS <br>
    Words like "tomorrow" or "future" or "fate" <br>
    No matter how far they extend their hands <br>
    We breathe, we dream, we raise our love <br>
    In a timeless land that is far out of reach <br>
    Even the second, hour hands of the clock <br>
    They look at us sideways as they tick and tock <br>
    How I hope to have forever to spend <br>
    This life, noâ€”all future lives <br>
    Right here in this world with you <br>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="ser">
    Rosy cheeks and warm summer air, <br>
    Walking side by side, <br>
    beneath the daylight's glare. <br>
    Pulsing hearts and feeling shy, <br>
    passing smiles with our eyes. <br>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="ser1">
    Armours fall as stories unfold, <br>
    I linger on every word you say.<br>
    Laughing with you as time ticks by,<br>
    All I want is to ask you to stay.<br>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="ser2">
    Cigarettes at sunset, <br>
    the music blaring high,<br>
    dancing in starlight,<br>
    bewitched by your eyes.<br>
    You lean in to kiss me,<br>
    it's surreal as a daydream,<br>
    sweet, and laced with mint and nicotine.
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="ser3">
    It seems like fate was at play here.<br>
    We were meant to be, dear.<br>
    Easy marks of Cupid's arrow,<br>
    left a feeling I can't outgrow.<br>
    Can it be too good to be true?<br>
    Take my hand,<br>
    let's see it through and through.
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="bottom">
    Even the way that you loved <br>
    I swear I could smell the scent of yours <br>
    And in the way that you walked <br>
    I could hear that bright laughter of yours <br>
    Since one day you will disappear <br>
    I'll keep every part of you <br>
    Make sure that it's burned into the back of my eyes <br>
    It's not a right that I'm due <br>
    My duty that is must have been kept <br>
    JUST AFRAID OF MANY THINGS THAT ARE AHEAD
